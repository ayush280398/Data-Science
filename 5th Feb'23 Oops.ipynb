    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit \n",

    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class.\n",
    "It provides a way to perform a single action in different ways based on the object type or class.\n",
    "Polymorphism enables code to be written that can work with objects of different types, providing flexibility and extensibility \n",
    "to the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction involves the concept of representing complex real-world entities in a simplified manner in software \n",
